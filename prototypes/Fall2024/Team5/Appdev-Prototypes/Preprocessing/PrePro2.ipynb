Similarly, interest expense is an expenditure normally associated with noncurrent liabilities rather than resulting from daily operations.

Now, through a comprehensive illustration, these categories will be combined into a formal and complete statement. The following information has been uncovered within the internal records maintained by the Ashe Corporation for the Year 2XX1. The company is a small organization that was incorporated several years ago in the western part of North Carolina.\\nA few of the significant financial events that occurred during the current year are as follows:\\no Land that had cost Ashe $7,000 several years ago was sold to an outside buyer. o  A building was also sold but for $210,000 in cash. This property had an original cost of $230,000.

As shown in the balance sheet, cash increased\\n\\n\\nfrom $1,000 to $27,000 during the course of this year. That $26,000 change should be explained. How does a company construct an entire statement of cash flows?Application of the indirect method for presenting operating activities is so prevalent that company officials have decided to use it.\\nOperating Activities\\n\",\n          \"For the year ended September 27, 2008, The Walt Disney Company reported the net outflow of over $2.1 billion in cash\\n as a result of its investing activities during that period (all numbers in millions):\\nFigure 17.9 The Walt Disney Company Investing Activity Cash Flows for Year Ended September 27, 2008 This portion of Disney's statement of cash flows shows that a number of nonoperating asset transactions created this $2.1 billion reduction in cash. Information about management decisions is readily available. For example, a potential investor can see that officials chose to spend cash of almost $1.6 billion during this year in connection with Disney's parks, resorts and other property.\\nInterestingly, this expenditure level is almost exactly the same as the monetary amount invested in those assets in the previous year.\\nWith knowledge of financial accounting, a portrait of a business and its activities begins to become clear.\\nAfter the cash amounts are determined, conveyance of this information does not appear particularly complicated.

In this process, controversies often arise. When FASB Statement 95, Statement of Cash Flows, was issued in 1987, three of the seven board members voted against its passage. Their opposition, at least in part, came from the handling of interest and dividends. On page ten of that standard, they argue \\\"that interest and dividends received are returns on investments in debt and equity securities that should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. They believe that interest paid is a cost of obtaining financial resources that should be classified as a cash outflow for financing activities.\\\"\\nThe other board members were not convinced. Thus, inclusion of dividends collected, interest collected, and interest paid within an entity's operating activities became a part of U.S. GAAP. Such disagreements arise frequently in the creation of official accounting rules.\\nThe majority of the board apparently felt that\\u2014because these transactions occur on a regular ongoing basis\\u2014a better portrait of the organization's cash flows is provided by including them within operating activities. At every juncture of financial accounting, multiple possibilities for reporting exist. Rarely is complete consensus ever achieved as to the most appropriate method of presenting financial information.\\nTalking with an Independent Auditor about International Financial Reporting Standards (Continued)\\nFollowing is the conclusion of our interview with Robert A. Vallejo, partner with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\n\\n\",\n          \"In both the direct and indirect methods, cash flows from operating activities are derived by following several specific steps:\\n1. Start with net income, either the balance for the period (the indirect method) or the income statement as a whole (the direct method).\\n\\n\\nRemove noncash expenses such as depreciation.\\n\\n\\nRemove nonoperating gains and losses because they relate to either investing activities or financing activities.\\n\\n\\nConvert the remaining revenue and expense balances from accrual accounting to cash accounting by adjusting for the changes occurring during the year in related connector accounts.\\n\\n\\nBecause the indirect method is being used here, the preparation of the operating activities section begins with Ashe Corporation's reported net income of $40,000.\\n\\n\\nDepreciation is eliminated. This year, the reported amount is $70,000 (buildings) and $30,000 (equipment). As expenses, depreciation is a negative within net income. To remove these two negative amounts, they are added back to the net income figure. Negatives are removed by the inclusion of a positive.\\n\\n\\nLikewise, both the loss on the sale of land and the gain on sale of a building are removed. Neither relates to an operating activity. The loss is eliminated by an addition to net income while the gain is offset by means of a subtraction.\\n\\n\\nOnly one step remains: adjustment for increases and decreases in the various connector accounts reported by Ashe Corporation in its balance sheet accounts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 17.24 Ashe Corporation\\u2014Change in Connector Accounts The change in each of these six connector accounts\\u2014accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, wages payable, interest payable, and taxes payable\\u2014must be factored into the computation of cash flows from operating activities to arrive at the actual effect on cash for the period.\\n\\n\\nAccounts receivable\\u2014increase of $15,000. The receivables balance rises because more sales are made on credit than cash is collected. The reduction in the cash received causes the receivable to go up. This decrease in cash collections is reflected by subtracting the $15,000 from net income. Inventory\\u2014decrease of $4,000. The inventory balance dropped, which indicates that less inventory was bought than was sold this year. Fewer purchases take less money, keeping the cash balance high. The decrease in inventory and its impact on cash are reported by an addition to net income. Accounts payable\\u2014increase of $4,000. Liabilities increase because more debt is acquired than the amount of cash paid. Slowness of payment increases accounts payable but also helps keep the company's cash balance high. This increase in accounts payable must be added to net income to arrive at the cash flows from operating activities. Wages payable\\u2014increase of $3,000 and interest payable\\u2014increase of $1,000. Both of these accrued liabilities went up during this year. Once again, an increase in a liability indicates a reduction in payments. This saving of cash is shown within the indirect method by adding the increases in wages payable and interest payable to net income. Taxes payable\\u2014decrease of $1,000. A liability goes down because of cash payments that reduce the obligation. However, they also shrink the amount of cash held. This effect is mirrored by subtracting the decrease in the liability from net income.\\nThe steps for determining cash flows generated by operating activities have been completed (using the indirect method) and this part of the statement of cash flows can be prepared.\\nFigure 17.25 Ashe Corporation Cash Flows from Operating Activities for Year Ended December 31, 2XX1\\u2014Indirect Method As can be seen here, cash generated by operating activities ($131,000) is considerably higher than the net income reported for the period ($40,000). That is not uncommon in the world of business especially since depreciation is often a large expense that does not require cash.\\nInvesting Activities\\n\\n\\nAfter accounting for operating activities, only three asset accounts remain to be examined (along with their accumulated depreciation balances where appropriate): land, buildings, and equipment. The accountant looks at each individually and attempts to recreate the transactions that brought about the various changes during the year. Land decreased by $7,000 ($21,000 to $14,000). The information provided states that land costing $7,000 was sold but does not indicate the amount of cash received in the exchange. However, the income statement discloses a $5,000 loss on the sale of land. When land costing $7,000 is sold at a $5,000 loss, only $2,000 in cash is received. The journal entry recorded by Ashe Corporation must have been as follows.\\nFigure 17.26 Assumed Journal Entry for Sale of Land Land is an asset so this inflow of cash will be reported as an investing activity.\\n\\nBuildings increased by $30,000 ($390,000 to $420,000). According to the introductory information, one building with a cost of\\n\\n$230,000 and a net book value of $200,000 (related accumulated depreciation was identified as $30,000) was sold during this year for $210,000. Those amounts create the $10,000 gain that appears in the company's income statement.\\nFigure 17.27 Assumed Journal Entry for Sale of Building\\n\\nThis transaction will be listed as a cash inflow within investing activities. However, the change in the buildings account is not\\n\\nyet fully explained. The above sale drops that account from $390,000 to $160,000 (a $230,000 reduction in cost). The final balance for the year was not $160,000 but rather $420,000, an increase of $260,000. Without mention of additional transactions, the assumption is made that another building was acquired during the period at that price.\\nFigure 17.28 Assumed Journal Entry for Purchase of Building\\n\\nThis second building transaction is also included within the investing activities but as a cash outflow. Equipment increased by $14,000 ($36,000 to $50,000). The provided information states that one piece of equipment was\\n purchased during the year for $44,000. This transaction identifies another cash outflow to be reported.\\nFigure 17.29 Assumed Journal Entry for Purchase of Equipment This journal entry does not entirely explain the change that occurred in the equipment account. The beginning balance of\\n $36,000 grew to $80,000 as a result of this purchase. Yet, the ending balance was just $50,000. Another $30,000 reduction\\n\\n($80,000 less $50,000) took place. Equipment accounts decrease as the result of a sale or some other type of disposal. The\\n\\n\\n$30,000 is the cost of equipment that was sold this period.\\nIn recording the disposal of a long-lived asset, removal of any related accumulated depreciation is also necessary. For the equipment reported by Ashe Corporation, beginning accumulated depreciation was $17,000\\u2014a figure that increased by $30,000 due to depreciation for that year (to a balance of $47,000). Ending accumulated depreciation account shows a balance of only\\n$20,000. The apparent reduction of $27,000 ($47,000 less $20,000) must have been the amount relating to the equipment that was sold. That was the accumulated depreciation removed in recording the disposal of this asset. Because no gain or loss is reported in the income statement on the disposal of equipment, the amount received must have been\\n equal to the $3,000 net book value of the asset ($30,000 less $27,000).\\nFigure 17.30 Assumed Journal Entry for Sale of Equipment All the changes in the land, buildings, and equipment accounts have now been examined. Each individual transaction was\\n\\nrecreated and the change in cash calculated. The investing activity section of the statement of cash flows is prepared as follows.\\nFigure 17.31 Ashe Corporation Cash Flows from Investing Activities for Year Ended December 31, 2XX1\\nFinancing Activities\\nOnly three accounts remain unexamined: notes payable, capital stock, and retained earnings. They are all either liabilities or\\n\\nstockholders' equity accounts and, thus, lead to financing activities. Notes payable increased by $10,000 ($120,000 to $130,000). The information gathered from the company disclosed the signing of a note payable for $110,000 in cash. This first transaction is obviously an inflow of that amount of cash.\\nFigure 17.32 Assumed Journal Entry for Signing of Note Payable According to the beginning and ending balance sheets, notes payable did not increase by $110,000 but only by $10,000. Thus, another transaction must have taken place that reduced this liability by $100,000. Notes payable decrease because of cash payments. Because no gain or loss on extinguishment of debt is reported in the income statement, Ashe Corporation must have paid exactly $100,000 to retire that same amount of debt.\\n\\n\\nFigure 17.33 Assumed Journal Entry for Extinguishment of Note Payable\\n\\n\\nThe recording of this second transaction leads to the appropriate change in notes payable ($10,000 increase created by a\\n\\n\\n\\n $110,000 liability increase and a $100,000 decrease). It also uncovers another cash flow from financing activities: the $100,000 that was paid on the liability. Capital stock increased by $5,000 ($50,000 to $55,000). The information states that Ashe Corporation issued stock to an investor for $5,000. That contribution created this account change.\\nFigure 17.34 Assumed Journal Entry for Issuance of Capital Stock\\n\\n\\n\\nThe business received this money and must report a financing activity cash inflow of $5,000. No other stock transactions are indicated.\\nRetained earnings increased by $9,000 ($140,000 to $149,000). This final balance sheet account increased by $40,000 because of the net income earned by Ashe Corporation this year. This amount is closed into retained earnings at the end of the year. The cash flows relating to net income have already been presented above within operating activities. Retained earnings must have also declined by $31,000 to create the overall change of $9,000. As mentioned previously, other than net income, retained earnings are changed by virtually only one other event: the distribution of dividends. The information mentions that a dividend was paid this year and must have made up this $31,000 difference.

takes the ledger account for each nonoperating asset (land, buildings, equipment, patents, trademarks, and the like) and investigates the individual transactions that took place during the year. The amount of every cash change is identified and reported. A cash sale of land creates an inflow whereas the acquisition of a building probably requires the payment of some cash. The difficulty in this process can come from having to sort through multiple purchases and sales to compute the exact amount of cash involved in each transaction. At times, determining these cash effects resembles the work required to solve a puzzle with many connecting pieces. Often, the accountant must replicate the journal entries that were made originally. Even then, the cash portion of these transactions may have to be determined by mathematical logic. To illustrate, assume that a company reports the following account balances.\\nFigure 17.10 Account Balances for Illustration Purposes In looking through business records for Year One, assume that the accountant finds two additional pieces of information about the\\n\\n\\nabove accounts:\\nEquipment costing $600,000 was sold this year for cash.\\nOther equipment was acquired, also for cash.\\nSale of equipment. This transaction is analyzed first because the cost of the equipment is already provided. However, the accumulated depreciation relating to the disposed asset is not known. The accountant must study the available data to determine that missing number because that balance is also removed when the asset is sold. Accumulated depreciation at the start of the year was $300,000 but depreciation expense of $230,000 was then reported as shown above. This expense was recognized through the following year-end adjustment.\\nFigure 17.11 Assumed Adjusting Entry for Depreciation\\n\\nThe entry here increases the accumulated depreciation account to $530,000 ($300,000 plus $230,000). However, the end balance is not $530,000 but only $450,000. What caused the $80,000 drop in this contra asset account?\\nAccumulated depreciation represents the cost of a long-lived asset that has already been expensed. Virtually the only situation in which accumulated depreciation is reduced is the disposal of the related asset. Here, the accountant knows that equipment was sold. Although the amount of accumulated depreciation relating to that asset is unknown, the assumption can be made that it is equal to this reduction of $80,000. No other possible decrease in accumulated depreciation is mentioned. Thus, the accountant believes equipment costing $600,000 but with accumulated depreciation of $80,000 (and, hence, a net book value of $520,000) was sold for an amount resulting in the $74,000 gain that is shown in the reported figures presented above. A hypothetical journal entry can be constructed from this information.\\nFigure 17.12 Assumed Journal Entry for Sale of Equipment This journal entry only balances if the cash received is $594,000. Equipment with a book value of $520,000 was sold during the\\n\\n\\nyear at a reported gain of $74,000. Apparently, $594,000 was received. How does all of this information affect the statement of cash flows?\\nA cash inflow of $594,000 is reported within investing activities with a labeling such as cash received from sale of equipment.\\nDepreciation of $230,000 is eliminated from net income in computing cash flows from operating activities because this expense had no impact on cash flows. The $74,000 gain on sale of equipment is also eliminated from net income but because it does not relate to an operating activity. The $594,000 in cash collected is shown but as an inflow from an investing activity.\\nPurchase of equipment. According to the information provided, another asset was acquired this year but its cost is unavailable. Once again, the accountant must puzzle out the amount of cash involved in the transaction. The equipment account began the year with a $730,000 balance. The sale of equipment costing $600,000 was just discussed. This transaction should have dropped the ledger account total to $130,000 ($730,000 less $600,000). However, at the end of the period, the balance reported for this asset is actually $967,000. How does the cost of equipment grow from $130,000 to $967,000? If no other transaction is mentioned, the most reasonable explanation is that equipment was acquired at a cost of $837,000 ($967,000 less\\n$130,000). Unless information is available indicating that part of this purchase was made on credit, the journal entry that was recorded originally must have been as follows.\\nFigure 17.13 Assumed Journal Entry for Purchase of Equipment\\n\\nAt this point, the changes in all related accounts (equipment, accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense, and gain on sale of\\n\\nequipment) have been utilized to determine the two transactions for the period and the cash inflows and outflows. In the statement of cash flows for this company, the investing activities are listed as follows.\\nFigure 17.14 Statement of Cash Flows Investing Activities Exercise Link to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2093020.html Exercise Link to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2093022.html Exercise Link to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2093000.html \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Even slight movements in projected EPS figures can create significant swings in the market price of a company's stock. Do you think there is an overemphasis on EPS in the public's investing decisions? How closely do you pay attention to EPS figures that are reported by the businesses that you are following? >Kevin Burns: This is a very good question. By now students must realize that accounting is really all about estimates. Although investors would like accounting to be objectively exact, reporting such estimates really requires an awful lot of subjectivity. For example, for many years, General Electric would almost always report EPS a penny or two above market expectations. This was quarter after quarter like clockwork. It got to the point where if the company didn't \\\"beat\\\" the estimates on the street by a penny or two, the market was disappointed. It is absurd to believe that this is meaningful. This is especially true when earnings can also be managed simply by delaying or speeding up a major transaction from one time period to another. So, yes, I believe that EPS, although important, is not the ultimate piece of information that some investors seem to think. I am much more concerned about asset values, growth prospects, and what a company does with the cash it is able to generate.\\n\\n\\nVideo Clip\\n\\\" href=\\\"http://app.wistia.com/embed/medias/b0a9c69a1e\\\" class=\\\"replaced-iframe\\\">(click to see video)\\n\\nUnnamed Author talks about the five most important points in Chapter 16 \\\"In a Set of Financial Statements, What Information Is Conveyed about Shareholders' Equity?\\\".\\n\\nThis page titled 16.5: The Computation of Earnings per Share is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Anonymous via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\\n\\n16.6: End-Of-Chapter Exercises\\n\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\n\\nWhat are the three legal forms of business?\\n\\n\\nHow does the number of owners differ among the three forms?\\n\\n\\nWhat is the process for incorporating a business? 4.

Describe the purpose of a statement of cash flows.\\n\\nDefine \\\"cash\\\" and \\\"cash equivalents.\\\" 3. Identify the three categories of cash flows used for reporting purposes. 4. Indicate the type of transactions that are reported as operating activities and provide common examples. 5. Indicate the type of transactions that are reported as investing activities and provide common examples. 6. Indicate the type of transactions that are reported as financing activities and provide common examples.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Many investors watch the movement of a company's reported net income and earnings per share and make investment decisions based on increases or decreases. Other investors argue that the amount of cash flows generated by operating activities is really a more useful figure. When you make investing decisions are you more inclined to look at net income or cash flows generated by operating activities? >Kevin Burns: As I have said previously, net income and earnings per share have a lot of subjectivity to them. Unfortunately, cash flow information can be badly misused also. A lot of investors seem fascinated by EBITDA which is the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. I guess you could say that it is kind of like blending net income and cash flows. But, to me, interest and taxes are real cash expenses so why exclude them? The biggest mistake I ever made as an investor or financial advisor was putting too much credence in EBITDA as a technique for valuing a business. Earnings are earnings and that is important information. A lot of analysts now believe that different cash flow models should be constructed for different industries. If you look around, you can find cable industry cash flow models, theater cash flow models, entertainment industry cash flow models, and the like. I think that is a lot of nonsense.\\n\\n\\nYou have to obtain a whole picture to know if an investment is worthwhile. While cash generation is important in creating\\n\\nthat picture so are actual earnings and a whole lot of other financial information.\\nThis page titled 17.4: Cash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Anonymous via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\\n\\n17.5: Appendix\\n\\n \\u00b7 Comprehensive Illustration-Statement Of Cash Flows\\n\",\n          \"Liberto has one revenue and three expenses left on its income statement. To arrive at the net cash flows from operating activities, the cash inflow or outflow relating to each must be determined. Assume that the following changes took place during this year in the related connector accounts:\\nAccounts receivable: up $19,000 Inventory: down $12,000 Prepaid rent: up $4,000 Accounts payable: up $9,000 Salary payable: down $5,000 In applying the direct method to determine operating activity cash flows, how are the individual figures to be disclosed computed?\\n\\n\\nAnswer:\\nSales to customers were reported on the income statement as $480,000. During that same period, accounts receivable increased by $19,000. Less money was collected than the amount of credit sales. That is what causes a rise in receivables. Consequently, the cash received from customers was only $461,000 ($480,000 less $19,000). Salary expense was reported as $60,000. For that time period, salary payable went down by $5,000. More cash must have been paid to cause this drop in the liability. The amount actually paid to employees was $65,000 ($60,000 plus $5,000). Rent expense was reported as $30,000. Prepaid rent increased by $4,000 from the first of the year to the end. This connector account is an asset. Because the asset increased, Liberto must have paid an extra amount for rent. Cash paid for rent was $34,000 ($30,000 plus $4,000). Cost of goods sold has been left to last because it requires an extra step. The company first determines the quantity of inventory bought this period. Only then can the cash payment made for those acquisitions be determined.\\nHere, cost of goods sold was reported as $250,000. However, the balance held in inventory fell by $12,000. Thus, the company bought $12,000 less inventory than it sold. Fewer purchases cause a drop in inventory. The amount of inventory acquired during the period was only $238,000 ($250,000 less $12,000).\\nNext, the cash paid for those purchases is calculated. As indicated by the information provided, accounts payable went up\\n$9,000. Liabilities increase because less money is paid. Although $238,000 of merchandise was acquired, only $229,000 in cash payments were made ($238,000 less $9,000).\\nFigure 17.6 Liberto Company Statement of Cash Flows for Year One, Operating Activities Reported by Direct Method\\n\\nLiberto's income statement reported net income of $100,000. However, the cash generated by operating activities during this same period was $133,000. The conversion from accrual accounting to operating cash inflows and outflows required three steps.\\n\\n\\nNoncash revenues and expenses (depreciation, in this example) were removed. These accounts do not represent cash transactions.\\n\\n\\nNonoperating gains and losses (the gain on sale of equipment, in this example) were removed. These accounts reflect investing and financing activities and the resulting cash flows are reported in those sections rather than within the operating activities.\\n\\n\\nThe change in each related connector account during the period is used to adjust the remaining income statement figures to the amount of cash physically exchanged. Accrual accounting figures are converted to cash balances.\\n\\n\\nExercise\\nLinks to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2093018.html Exercise Links to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092993.html Exercise Links to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092995.html Exercise Links to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092975.html\\nKey Takeaway\\n\\n\\nAn entity's cash flows from operating activities can be derived and reported by either the direct method or the indirect method.\\nFASB expressed preference for the direct method but the indirect method is used by most businesses in the United States. The process begins with the income for the period (the entire income statement for the direct method but just net income for the indirect method). Noncash items and nonoperating gains and losses are eliminated entirely. In the direct method, the remaining revenue and expense accounts are individually converted into cash figures. For each, the change in one or more related balance sheet connector accounts is taken into consideration. Thus, the reported U.S. GAAP (accrual accounting) figures can be turned into the underlying cash inflows and outflows for reporting purposes.\\n1 For convenience, the allowance for doubtful accounts will not be included with accounts receivable. The possibility of bad debts makes the conversion to cash more complicated and is covered in upper-level accounting textbooks.\\nThis page titled 17.2: Cash Flows from Operating Activities- The Direct Method is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Anonymous via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\\n\\n17.3: Cash Flows From Operating Activities- The Indirect Method\\n\\n\\nAt the end of this section, students should be able to meet the following objectives:\\n1. Explain the difference in the start of the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows when the indirect method is used rather than the direct method.\\n\\n\\nDemonstrate the removal of noncash items and nonoperating gains and losses in the application of the indirect method. 3. Determine the effect caused by the change in the various connector accounts when the indirect method is used to present cash flows from operating activities.\\n\\n\\nIdentify the reporting classification for interest revenues, dividend revenues, and interest expense in creating a statement of cash flows and describe the controversy that resulted from this handling.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The proper recognition of revenue is one of the most challenging tasks encountered in financial accounting. Here, the simplest way to resolve this issue is to consider the nature of the task to be performed.\\nIs this job a single task to be carried out by the company over thirty days or is it thirty distinct tasks to be handled once a day over this period of time? If the work of feeding and caring for the horses is one large task like painting a house, then the earning process is only 5/30 finished at the moment and not substantially complete. No revenue is recognized until the work has been performed for twenty-five more days. The previous adjusting entry is not warranted. Conversely, if this assignment is thirty separate tasks, then five of them are substantially complete and revenue of $500 is properly recorded by the above entry. Unfortunately, the distinction is not always clear. Because accounting is conservative, revenue should never be recognized unless evidence predominates that the individual tasks are clearly separate events.\\nExercise Link to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092646.html \",\n          \"Inventory, which is an asset, increases by $2,000. The organization has more inventory than it did prior to the purchase. Because no money has yet been paid for these goods, a liability for the same amount has been created. The term accounts payable is often used in financial accounting to represent debts resulting from the acquisition of inventory and supplies. inventory (asset) increases by $2,000 accounts payable (liability) increases by $2,000 Note that the accounting equation described in the previous chapter remains in balance. Assets have gone up by $2,000 while the liability side of the equation has also increased by the same amount to reflect the source of this increase in the company's assets.\\n\\nLink to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092605.html \",\n          \"Because no sale is expected in the near term, the fair value of available-for-sale shares will possibly go up and down numerous times before being sold. Hence, the current gain is not viewed as \\\"sure enough.\\\" As a result of this uncertainty, a change\\n\\n\\nin the owner's reported net income is not considered appropriate. Instead, any unrealized gain (or loss) in the value of an\\n\\n\\ninvestment that is classified as available-for-sale is reported within the stockholders' equity section on the balance sheet. The figure is listed either just above or below the retained earnings account. A few other unrealized gains and losses are handled in this manner and are usually combined and reported as \\\"other accumulated comprehensive income.\\\"\\nFigure 12.8 Stockholders' Equity Including Other Accumulated Comprehensive Income Changes in the value of trading securities create unrealized gains or losses that are reported in the income statement. Changes in the value of available-for-sale securities also create unrealized gains and losses but they are shown in stockholders' equity and not net income.\\nThe above procedures were first created in 1993 and have been used since that time. Interestingly, in 2007, FASB passed a rule that allows companies to elect to report available-for-sale investments in the same manner as trading securities. This option must be selected when the investment is purchased. Thus, if that election is made, the $3,000 unrealized gain above is reported on the income statement despite the intention to hold the securities for an indefinite period. This is another example of accounting rules that are not as rigid as sometimes perceived.\\nExercise Link to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092972.html \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this book, justification for the serious study that is required to master the subject matter is simple and straightforward: obtaining a working knowledge of financial accounting and its underlying principles enables a person to understand the information conveyed about an organization so that better decisions can be made.\\nAround the world, millions of individuals make critical judgments each day about the businesses and other organizations they encounter. Developing the ability to analyze financial information and then using that knowledge to arrive at sound decisions can be critically important. Whether an organization is as gigantic as Wal-Mart or as tiny as a local convenience store, a person could have many, varied reasons for making an assessment. As just a single example, a recent college graduate looking at full-time employment opportunities might want to determine the probability that Company A will have a brighter economic future than Company B. Although such decisions can never be correct 100 percent of the time, knowledge of financial accounting and the information being communicated greatly increases the likelihood of success. As Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations, has said, \\\"Knowledge is power. Information is liberating .\\\"\\n1 Thus, the ultimate purpose of this book is to provide students with a rich understanding of the rules and nuances of financial accounting so they can evaluate available information and then make good choices about those organizations. In the world of business, most successful individuals have developed this talent and are able to use it to achieve their investing and career objectives. \",\n          \"As indicated, financial accounting is designed to portray the overall financial condition and prospects of an organization.\\nEvery employee should be quite interested in assessing that information to judge future employment prospects. A company that is doing well will possibly award larger pay raises or perhaps significant end-of-year cash bonuses. A financially healthy organization can afford to hire new employees, buy additional equipment, or pursue major new initiatives. Conversely, when a company is struggling and prospects are dim, employees might anticipate layoffs, pay cuts, or reductions in resources. Thus, although financial accounting information is often directed to outside decision makers, employees should be vitally interested in the financial health of their own organization. No one wants to be clueless as to whether their employer is headed for prosperity or bankruptcy. In reality, employees are often the most avid readers of the financial accounting information distributed by their employers because the results can have such an immediate and direct impact on their jobs and, hence, their lives.\\nFinancial accounting encompasses the rules and procedures to convey financial information about an organization. Individuals who attain a proper level of knowledge of financial accounting can utilize this information to make decisions based on the organization's perceived financial health and outlook. Such decisions might include assessing employment potential, lending money, granting credit, and buying or selling ownership shares. However, financial accounting does not address issues that are purely of an internal nature, such as whether an organization should buy or lease equipment or the level of pay raises. Information to guide such internal decisions is generated according to managerial accounting rules and procedures that are introduced in other books and courses. Despite not being directed toward the inner workings of an organization, employees are interested in financial accounting because it helps them assess the future financial prospects of their employer.\\n1 See http://www.deepsky.com/~madmagic/kofi.html.\\n2 Tax accounting serves as another distinct branch of accounting. It is less focused on decision making and more on providing the information needed to comply with all government rules and regulations. Even in tax accounting, though, decision making is important as companies seek to take all possible legal actions to minimize tax payments.\\nThis page titled 1.1: Making Good Financial Decisions about an Organization is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA license and was authored,\\n remixed, and/or curated by Anonymous via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\\n1.2: Incorporation And The Trading Of Capital Shares\\n\\n\\nLearning Objectives At the end of this section, students should be able to meet the following objectives:\\n1. Define \\\"incorporation.\\\"\\n2. Explain the popularity of investing in the capital stock of a corporation. 3. Discuss the necessity and purpose of a board of directors. 4. List the potential benefits gained from acquiring capital stock.\\n\",\n          \"The number of possible judgments that an individual might need to make about a business or other organization is close to\\n\\n\\nunlimited. However, many decisions deal with current financial health and the prospects for future success. In making assessments of available data, a working knowledge of financial accounting is invaluable. The more in-depth the understanding is of those principles, the more likely the person will be able to use the available information to arrive at the best possible choice. Common examples include the following:\\nThe college graduate might be employed by a bank to work in its corporate lending department. Company C is a local business that has applied to the bank for a large loan. The graduate has been asked by bank management to prepare an assessment of Company C to determine if it is likely to be financially healthy in the future so that it will be able to repay the money when due. A correct decision to lend the money eventually earns the bank profit because Company C (the debtor) will be required to pay an extra amount (known as interest) on the money borrowed. Conversely, an incorrect analysis of the information could lead to a substantial loss if the loan is granted and Company C is unable to fulfill its obligation. Bank officials must weigh the potential for profit against the risk of loss. That is a daily challenge in virtually all businesses. The former student's career with the bank might depend on the ability to analyze financial accounting data and then make appropriate choices about the actions to be taken. Should a loan be made to this company? The college graduate might hold a job as a credit analyst for a manufacturing company that sells its products to retail stores.\\nCompany C is a relatively new retailer that wants to buy goods (inventory) for its stores on credit from this manufacturer. The former student must judge whether it is wise to permit Company C to buy goods now but wait until later to remit the money. If payments are received on a timely basis, the manufacturer will have found a new outlet for its merchandise. Profits will likely increase. Unfortunately, another possibility also exists. Company C could make expensive purchases but then be unable to make payment, creating significant losses for the manufacturer. Should credit be extended to this company?\\nThe college graduate might be employed by an investment firm that provides financial advice to its clients. The firm is presently considering whether to recommend acquisition of the ownership shares of Company C as a good investment strategy.\\nThe former student has been assigned to gather and evaluate relevant financial information as a basis for this decision. If Company C is poised to become stronger and more profitable, its ownership shares will likely rise in value over time, earning money for the firm's clients. Conversely, if the prospects for Company C appear to be less bright, the value of these shares might be expected to drop (possibly precipitously) so that the investment firm should avoid suggesting the purchase of an ownership interest in Company C. Should shares of this company be recommended for acquisition?\\nSuccess in life\\u2014especially in business\\u2014frequently results from making appropriate decisions. Many economic choices, such as those described above, depend on the ability to understand and make use of the financial information that is produced and presented about an organization in accordance with the rules and principles underlying financial accounting.\\n\\nLink to multiple-choice question for practice purposes: http://www.quia.com/quiz/2092614.html \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Relevant_Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1 Thus, the ultimate purpose of this book is to provide students with a rich understanding of the rules and nuances of financial accounting so they can evaluate available information and then make good choices about those organizations.
